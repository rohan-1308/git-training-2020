# Assignment Instructions

1. Create a fork of the repository by clicking the "fork" button
2. Create a branch from the `assignment-start` branch
3. Recover the original README file made in the root commit
4. Modify the `<title>...</title>` in the [index.html](./index.html) file to say "Example"
5. Raise a pull request to the original ThoughtClan repository's **master branch**

These instructions must not be present in the final README file submitted by your pull request.
If your pull request does not have conflict with the master branch, then you've gone wrong and should restart. Ensuring you are creating a new branch from the `assignment-start` branch of the ThoughtClan repository.
